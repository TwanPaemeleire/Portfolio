                <h2>Roguelike Item System</h2>
                <p>
                    Before this project I had barely worked in Unreal c++, I aimed to change that with this.
                    It was a very interesting learning experience for me to see how c++ integrates into the engine, how it should be used effectively, and how different it is from standard C++.
                    As an avid fan of roguelike games, I thought it would be fun to recreate the item/inventory system from one of them.
                    I chose to try and replicate the system from a very well-known roguelike: <em>Risk of Rain 2</em>.
