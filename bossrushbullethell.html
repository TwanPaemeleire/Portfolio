                <h2>Boss-Rush Bullet-Hell</h2>
                <p>
                    I've always been a really big fan of boss battles in-game, especially in roguelikes.
                    I recently also discovered while working on TimeChained that I really like making bullet-hell related mechanics.
                    As such, I've decided to start on a passion project with those qualities.
                    The goal of this project is to have multiple bosses, whom have different difficulty tiers that slightly modify their attacks.
                    The player will fight through these bosses at their different difficulties in a random order every run, gaining upgrades between battles.<br><br>

                    I'll be working on this project on the side, next to my studies, and will be on the lookout for an artist and sound designer to join me in the development.<br><br>

                    The main inspiration for this project is a game called "The Void Rains Upon Her Heart".
                    After playing it recently, I came to the conclusion that I'd love to build something like it and figure out how to make it as scalable as I can.<br><br>

                    <b>NOTE: This project is in a very early stage of development, I am currently getting started on building up systems so that adding bosses
                        and attacks will be as scalable as possible.
