                <p>
                    I've always been a really big fan of boss battles in-game, especially in roguelikes.
                    While working on TimeChained I discovered a strong interest in designing bullet-hell related mechanics.
                    As such, I began a personal passion project that brings these elements together.
                    The goal of this project is to have multiple bosses, which have different difficulty tiers that slightly modify their attacks.
                    The player will face these bosses in a random order at varying difficulty levels, gaining upgrades between battles.<br><br>

                    I'll be working on this project on the side, alongside my studies, and am currently seeking an artist and sound designer to collaborate with.<br><br>

                    The main inspiration for this project is a game called "The Void Rains Upon Her Heart".
                    Playing it recently inspired me to create something similar. I'm excited about taking on the challenges that come along with it,
                    like figuring out how to make it as scalable as I can.<br><br>

                    <b>NOTE: This project is in a very early stage of development, I am currently working on building up scalable systems
                        to ensure development on the gameplay itself will go smoothly.
