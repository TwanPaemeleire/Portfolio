    <h2>TimeChained</h2>
    <p>
      TimeChained is a 2D game, made in Unity for the Beginner's Jam Summer 2025. We worked on this game with 3 programmers, 1 artist, and 1 sound designer.
      TimeChained takes light inspiration from some roguelikes, it features a level with obstacles and enemies, once the player has fought their way through this level, a bullethell-like boss fight awaits them.
      Created fully from scratch in a week, TimeChained placed 23 out of 123 games that were submitted to the jam!
