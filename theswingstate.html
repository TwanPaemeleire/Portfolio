                <p>
                    The swing state is a 1v1 party game where you play as 2 politicians of the opposing party, trying to get as many votes as possible.
                    This game was made as part of a two-day-long game jam organized by our school (Howest - Digital Arts and Entertainment). I worked in a team with one other developer, four artists and an animator.
                    Out of the 30 entries, we ended up getting an overal third place.
